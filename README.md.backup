This self-initiated project aims to produce useful analysis and visualizations, based on the data of over 415 movies and 100,000 showtimes it had scraped.

This project consists of three parts:

2. Data Visualization
3. Data Analysis

### Collecting and Modeling Data

All data used in this project were scraped from [hkmovie6](https://hkmovie6.com/) from October 2021 to June 2022.

Three scrapers were built to extract 🎞️movies data, 🎫showtimes data, and 💺seats occupancy data respectively.

The data were then processed and transformed by a pipeline, and finally written to a 💾SQLite database. (link to SQLite file on some cloud drive) 100,000 shows had been scraped.
